Note: all documentation is also publically available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=156oWPzwgLl_GuV0CgJz05fteXXoF2_m9D4l-2Izvjdc 

If documentation seems out-of-date or no longer works, trust the Google Drive. Chances are I've probably updated a ton on the Drive but not had time to transfer it over to the repo.
